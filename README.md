# Cryptocurrencies
Utilize Python and sklearn library to build an unsupervised machine learning model to classify cryptocurrencies for a new investment portfolio offering.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize Python for building an unsupervised machine learning model using K-means to cluster cryptocurrencies.  The process includes preprocessing the crypto dataset in order to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions.  Those dimensions are then utilized within the K-means algorithm to predict the proper clusters for the crypto data.  A scatterplot is produced to provide a visualization of the final crypto classifications as well as a table showing all tradable cryptocurrencies; both seen below.
